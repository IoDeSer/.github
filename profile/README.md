# Introduction
.io is text file format for data created by [Io-Maciek](https://github.com/Io-Maciek). Designed as a side-project that can serve as an interesting alternative to popular formats such as JSON or XML. This organisation account as well as all repositories in it are new and very little to no documentation is written for them, but they will be updated as soon as possible.

## Libraries
At the moment the most developed library is created for C# language [c-sharp-library](https://github.com/IoDeSer/c-sharp-library), but libraries for [rust](https://github.com/IoDeSer/rust-library), [python](https://github.com/IoDeSer/python-library) and [java](https://github.com/IoDeSer/java-library) exists, but are very buggy with most features not implemented or not working.

## Goals
Achive de/serialization of types such as primitives (integers, decimals, strings), arrays/lists and classes with as little symbols as possible (**|**, **+**, **->**, newline *\n* and tabualtor *\t*), that works the same across different programming languages.

## Status
Every library is in alpha status, and *should* ***NOT*** be used for production environments, but reather for tests, fun and development. The contributions, issues and ideas are very welcome!
